const roll_no=120  // const is constant it is fixed throughout the program whatever i decided in it

let age=12 // let is variable it is generally used instead of var

var Name='123' // var is also used but rarely because of block scope and functional scope 

let  job=null // null means no value

let company= undefined // undefined means value is not defined but variable is exist 

let pass=true // bool datatype output always in true/false

console.log(roll_no,age,Name,job,company)

console.log(typeof(Name));  // string
console.log(typeof(age));   //number
console.log(typeof(job));   //object
console.log(typeof(company)); //undefined
console.log(typeof(pass));    //boolean
